Welcome to my Homepage!

I used Vite to manage the bundling of the things I need

## How do I start the project up?

To startup the project on your machine do the following

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Should be all you need to get up and running

I used the lastest version node.js (which at the time was v16) for this project so make sure you use that or something like it

I have also setup a .nvmrc so if you use nvm you can just do `nvm use` inside the folder
